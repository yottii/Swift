# ChatServerCoop #

I want to migrate my ChatServer to an IOS Application,
and I thought I wanna to make ISO Application of FrontEnd.

# How to migrate ISO #

1. To Use Socket.io-swift-module - very hard and I have no time...

2. To Use UIwebview , it's very easy by making it.

I have used a UIwebview to making it.
